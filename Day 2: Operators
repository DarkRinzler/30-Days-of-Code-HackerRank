Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent 
(the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

Solution:

def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    total_cost = meal_cost + (tip_percent*meal_cost/100) + (tax_percent*meal_cost/100)
    total_cost = round(total_cost)
    print(total_cost)

    meal_cost = float(input().strip())

    tip_percent = int(input().strip())

    tax_percent = int(input().strip())

    solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent)
